# elgentos BundleQuick

Bundlequick allows you to quickly create a bundled product based on two or more simple products you have selected by using the Bundlequick mass update action. It will combine the name, sku, (short) description, categories and images.

All attributes that are present in both products (and thus attribute sets) and have the same value (say, manufacturer) will also be applied to the new bundle product.

The simple products are automatically added to the bundle product and the bundle product will become a 'Related product' for the simple products. This is configurable in the backend though.
